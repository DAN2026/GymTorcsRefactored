Notes from Dan:

- Ive refactored the snakeoil messy code into a neat orderly fashion that is actually readable to 
  a sane person and created packages for management.
- Ive seperated the network logic as much as I can from the actual main loop logic where our RL / classical
  machine brain will be running
